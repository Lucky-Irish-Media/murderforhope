# Why do we say a country is great?
How can America be anything? America is just a country made up of citizens. How can something that can't be anything, be great? Through our actions as a citizen. The greatness of the citizens of a country is equally measured by how they treat their minorities, oppressed, under represented; not their majority.  

# What color do you paint?
_"Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free._" This quote is on the Statue of Liberty; the beacon of what our countries "greatness" is hitched to. We need to ask ourselves what our actions paint upon the canvas of our country. Are we painting upon the canvas of America through tolerance or ignorance with our words and actions?

# What is Great?
What do we mean when we say "great"? Does it mean prosperous, equitable, or powerful? Many latch on to this word as a weapon, an excuse, but it can also be a salve. It doesn't have to be something we say, but something we show through our actions.
